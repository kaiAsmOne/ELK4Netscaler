# ELK4Netscaler
ELK Stack Setup for collecting Netscaler data. 

This project is focused on collecting AppFirewall (Netscaler WAF) messages.

This Logstash + Kibana setup is something i created to solve specific customer requests.
This Project is intended to provide enough information for someone skilled with Kibana. 

If you utilize my configuration i would appreciate Kibana Graphs or other "ELK for Netscaler" related data to add to this project.
